      * When a model requests a list of priors a list of distribution objects should be returned. Perhaps a Map<prior.id, new ContinuousDistribution())> may siffice.

      * SequentialMonteCarlo 
        - need a way of creating sequentially numbered writers to the underlying MCMC object.
        - need a technique to reject particles.

      * Version 2.0
        - Update JDK/JRE to version >= 11
        - Replace joda-time with improved datatime module in the JDK
        - Replace uk.com.robust-it.cloning.version with save-to-json-and-back approach
