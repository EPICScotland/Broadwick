/**
 * Implementing classes are used to observe certain aspects of simulations (stochastic processes). It is basically just
 * an interface of methods that get called during a simulation together with some common methods useful for many types
 * of observers.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * Some observers take repeats into account. If you repeat the simulations, they will yield average data.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * Each observer should override the
 * &lt;code&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt; method which should return a string representation of its data.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * You can register a {@link PrintWriter} to the
 * &lt;code&gt;Observer&lt;/code&gt;. If you have, the return value of
 * &lt;code&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt; is printed if a simulation has finished.
