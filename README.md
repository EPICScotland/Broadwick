Broadwick
=========

Broadwick generic modelling code framework (java)

## Introduction

Broadwick is a framework for developing sophisticated epidemiological based mathematical models, and consists of several Java libraries and bespoke packages.  The components of Broadwick are written in such a way that a scientist may combine them in order to rapidly prototype a model for a new specific scenario.

## Features

* Supports single (e.g. within herd) or structured populations (e.g. multi-species or locations)
* Inclusion of movement over network data (e.g. Cattle movement Tracing System)
* Stochastic Individual Based simulations (including fast approximate options)
* Approximate Bayesian Computation inference for estimating model parameters from data via simulations
* Monte Carlo Markov Chain inference for estimating model parameters from data
